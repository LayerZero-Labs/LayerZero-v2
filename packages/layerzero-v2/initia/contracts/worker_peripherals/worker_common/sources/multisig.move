// This multisig module was developed for use with DVN workers. It is used to manage the quorum and signers for
// a worker and to verify that the required number of signatures are present and valid when a change is made. It
// keeps track of used hashes to prevent the same command being replayed (all hashes should be hashed with an expiration
// time, which allows two of the otherwise same command to be called at different times).
// The important place where the configuration is used beyond direct multisig activity is that the fee_lib_0 depends on
// the quorum number set here to compute the send fee for the DVN, which scale with the quorum of signers required.
