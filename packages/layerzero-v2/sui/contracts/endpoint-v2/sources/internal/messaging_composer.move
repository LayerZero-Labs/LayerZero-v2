/// Messaging Composer
///
/// This module manages the composition messaging system within LayerZero V2, which enables
/// sequential execution of multiple actions after a cross-chain message is received.
/// Compose messages allow OApps to trigger additional operations on the destination chain
/// after the initial lz_receive execution completes.
///
/// **Flow:**
/// 1. OApp calls send_compose() during or after lz_receive to queue a compose message
/// 2. Message hash is stored in the composer's queue
/// 3. Executor calls lz_compose() to process the queued message
/// 4. clear_compose() marks the message as delivered and prevents re-execution
