/// This module provides a function to withdraw gas token using Coin methods.
///
/// This is necessary for chains that have a Coin representation of the gas token. The coin::withdraw function is aware
/// of both Coin<AptosCoin> and FungibleAsset(@0xa) balances unlike the fungible_asset::withdraw function which is only
/// aware of FungibleAsset(@0xa) balances.
///
/// This module should be swapped with native_token_fa.move for chains that have a fully FungibleAsset-based gas token.
